title: Principles
---

I've had the opportunity to work with lots of very smart people in a range of organizational contexts on some really incredible projects. I've learned a lot from each of these experiences that have profoundly shaped how I think about my work.

These principles represent some of the lessons I've learned:

## Collaborating with others
- Favor unblocking over blocking. If a decision can be made or action taken that unblocks, default to that option over remaining blocked.

### Communication
- In writing be clear and concise. Aim for the least amount of words necessary to clearly communicate context and response.
- Ask questions generously.
- If something is unclear, ask for clarification.
- Repeat things as much as is needed to make sure everyone is on the same page.

## Product design

-

## Leadership

- Commit clearly and intentionally.
- Set the example by what you do.
- Every time you interact with a team, your answer should be roughly yes or no. Leaving things open ended is death. Be laser focused and answer things affirmatively in such a way that moves things forward, and when you need to answer in the negative, be clear.

### Management

- Be great at following up.
- Be consistent in what you say.
- Be consistent in what you do based on what you've said.
- Be explicit about expectations.
- Tell why, not just what.
- Invite others to be stakeholders and empower them to take ownership.
- Don't tell people what to do and what not to do.
  - Good managers empower people to do what they want to do, and seek to understand why people want to do the things they don't think they should be doing.
- Lead others to conclusions they can make themselves, rather than just telling them what to do or giving them the answer.
- Be flexible and always lean in the direction that favors unblocking, empowering, iteration, and exploration – except in critical outcome situations, where you should lean in the direction of wisdom and away from unreasonable risk.
- Listen to your team and be open to their perspectives. They need that space, and you need their perspectives.
- Help your team achieve their goals. Be their biggest champion in the organization.
- Advocate for people. That's part of the job.
  - As a manager you should be your teams biggest advocate; Promoting their work and brag on them constantly, both for the benefit of your team's morale and self-esteem, and for the benefit of letting the rest of your organization know what impact your team is having, and what they are doing that the rest of the organization should know about.
- Shoot straight with people. It's far more helpful than trying to preserve feelings. But don't be an asshole. You can be both kind and considerate, and forthright and honest.
- If you are prepared to criticize something, be prepared to offer a solution. If you don't have a solution, ask a helpful question. Sometimes asking the right question is better than proposing a solution.
- When massive change happens, people lose vision and context; it's really important to help people feel like their work is not being stalled and can still move forward; when context disappears or the environment changes, you need to set a new vision and context as quickly as possible to reduce the entropy that naturally occurs.

### Design management

- The first thing that has to come before any meaningful design work is a conversation about the goals that work needs to accomplish. Break the problem wide open at the beginning.
- Start the design process with opportunity sketches in low fidelity to show what a solution could be like apart from UI treatments and hi fidelity comps; this is important because in discussing solutions with others, they need to understand the concept being discussed and not get distracted by completed looking designs.
- Presentation is really important; sell the idea; sell the experience; from concept, to prototype, to final execution; make it feel like the entire experience has been considered; that will help people experiencing your design or product to feel more confident in it.

### Teaching, mentorship, and coaching
- Tell what, explain why, show how, follow up.
- If a team member takes the initiative to ask you what they can do to support you, or the team, or go above and beyond their responsibilities to be a leader, don't just tell them to keep doing a good job, or their basic responsibilities. Give them a vision for what it looks like to be a leader, and tangible things they can do to practice and perform that way in your current team environment.
