## About the Site

This site is my personal home on the web. I write about stuff, I link to other stuff, and I showcase stuff I've done/built/designed. It's purely personal in nature and does not necessarily reflect the views of my employer, my family, my community, or anyone else besides me. It's just where I share things I've built, written, or done.

It lives here: [joelglovier.com](http://joelglovier.com)
