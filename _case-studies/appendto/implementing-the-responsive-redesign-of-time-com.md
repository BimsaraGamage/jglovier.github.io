In 2012 the online home of global news publisher TIME Magazine, time.com, was not easy to read on a phone's web browser. As a matter of fact, most news media wasn't easy to access on a phone's web browser at that time.

The Boston Globe, however, helped to usher in a new era of responsive web design by being the first major news outlet to feature a responsive web design – meaning that it's site content adapted to the device viewing it for an optimized reading and browsing experience.

In 2012 I was hired by appendTo, a front-end development shop, to work with Doug Neiner on a significant project that the shop was taking on: implementing a responsive redesign of TIME.com.
