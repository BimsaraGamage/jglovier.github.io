In 2012 the online home of global news publisher TIME Magazine, time.com, was not easy to read on a phone's web browser. As a matter of fact, most news media wasn't easy to access on a phone's web browser at that time.

The Boston Globe, however, helped to usher in a new era of responsive web design by being the first major news outlet to feature a responsive web design – meaning that it's site content adapted to the device viewing it for an optimized reading and browsing experience.

On October 22, 2012, TIME Magazine followed suit by becoming the [first global news publisher](http://techland.time.com/2012/10/22/the-new-time-com-a-responsive-global-news-site/) to launch a responsive web design.

As part of the the team at AppendTo working with TIME Magazine, I implemented a responsive design for TIME.com created by the TIME in house design team, along with [Doug Neiner](https://twitter.com/dougneiner) (project tech lead) and [Ralph Whitbeck](https://twitter.com/RedWolves) (project manager) at AppendTo.

## Understanding the problem

Prior to this effort, TIME.com was optimized for desktop browsers, and there was a separate mobile site for mobile devices. However, that left an experience that had a lot of gaps for users increasingly coming from different sized mobile devices, tablets, and other non-standard screens.

What TIME really wanted was an experience that has become standard today, but in 2012 was still very new: a responsive website that adapted to whatever screen size the person viewing their content on.

The responsive web design movement was still just beginning to gain traction, but there were already a lot of well established patterns and best practices in place, thanks in large part to pioneers of the movement like [Ethan Marcotte](https://ethanmarcotte.com/), whose A Book Apart book [Responsive Web Design](https://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design) influenced an entire industry of web designers seeking to adopt this new approach.

We also took inspiration from Nicolle Sullivan's [teaching](https://www.slideshare.net/stubbornella/object-oriented-css) on [OOCSS](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki), and Jonathan Snook's [Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS](https://smacss.com/) book as we approached the best way to architect the CSS.
