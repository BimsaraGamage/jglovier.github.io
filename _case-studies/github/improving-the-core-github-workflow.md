Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. I've had twelve years to think about it.

And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book?

The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me.

Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this?

We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Besides, you look good in a dress. I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself.

Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you.

Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody.

I'll be sure to note that in my log. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here.

Sorry, Data.

Well, that's certainly good to know. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others.

Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. Not if I weaken first.

My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? How long can two people talk about nothing?

I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir.
